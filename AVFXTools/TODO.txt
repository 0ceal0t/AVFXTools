binding bones is probably wrong
quads are probably wrong
emitter movement is probably wrong

how are  timed emitters created?
timeline / schedulers
bind target point type:
- origin
- fitground
- damaged circle
- by name
binder
- linear
- spline
- camera
bind to target/character model
trigger kicks
sound?
gravity / air resistance
injection axis
rotation velocity
emitter types
- cone
- sphere
- model
depth clip
draw state
collision
fesnel
particle types
- line
- windmill
- laser
- polygon
- polyline
- lightmodel
- morphmodel
- decal
- disc
texture reflection
texture palette
texture normal
effectors
- pointlight
- directional light
- radial blur
- blackhole
- cameraquake
scheduler
timeline clip
timeline start/end time
timeline parent influence
- scale / rotation / position
- inherit velocity
- life
- fit ground
injection angle
generate delay
binder rotation type
- standard
- billboard
- billboard axis y
- look at camera
- camera billboard axis y
binder ring
binder props
- scale, vfx scale
emitter looping
emitter effector
emitter anydirection
emitter types
rotation directions
- x,y,z
- move direction
- billboard axis y
- screen billboard
- move direction billboard
