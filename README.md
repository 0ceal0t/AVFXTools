Here be dragons

## TODO
### General
- [ ] ⚠️ random (what do the random types mean)
- [ ] curves
- [ ] velocity
### Particles
- [ ] ⚠️ draw mode
- [x] culling type
- [x] is depth test
- [x] is depth write
- [ ] ⚠️ soft particle
- [ ] tone map
- [ ] ⚠️ how colors / color scale interact
- [ ] brightness
- [ ] loop start / end
- [ ] ⚠️ fresnel
- [ ] texture normal
- [ ] texture reflection
- [ ] texture palette
- [ ] line particles
- [ ] windmill particles
- [ ] laser particles
- [ ] polygon particles
- [ ] polyline particles
- [ ] lightmodel particle (what's the difference?)
- [ ] morphmodel particle
- [ ] decal particle
- [ ] disc particle
- [ ] collision
- [ ] rotation base
- [ ] depth clip
- [ ] ⚠️ fix powder particles (gravity, etc)
### Emitters
- [ ] CreateTime / CreateCount: what do those mean? They already exist elsewhere, why are they in the emitter sub-items?
- [ ] Create Probability
- [ ] Parent Influence Coords / Color
- [ ] Influence Coords
- [ ] Influence Coord Binder Position
- [ ] Inherit Parent Life
- [ ] Override Life
- [ ] Parameter Link
- [ ] Start frame
- [ ] Injection angle
- [ ] generate delay
- [ ] generate delay by one
- [ ] local direction
- [ ] any direction
- [ ] cylinder emitter
- [ ] ⚠️ sphere emitter
### Effectors
### Timelines
### Schedulers
### Binders

TODO:
binding bones is probably wrong
quads are probably wrong
emitter movement is probably wrong

how are  timed emitters created?
